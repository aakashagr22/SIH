        <h1>Introduction to the Constitution of India</h1>
    
    <section id="section1">
        <p>
            The <strong>Constitution of India</strong>, adopted on January 26, 1950, is the supreme law of the country and serves as the foundation for its democratic governance. Drafted by the Constituent Assembly, it reflects the vision of a just and equitable society, ensuring fundamental rights and freedoms for all citizens. With its comprehensive framework, the Constitution outlines the structure of government, the distribution of powers, and the principles of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. As a dynamic and evolving document, it adapts to the changing needs of the nation while preserving its core values, guiding India towards unity, stability, and progress.

        <h2>Article 1 of the Indian Constitution</h2>
        <h3>What is Article 1?</h3>
        <p>
            Article 1 of the Indian Constitution is like the first page of a book that tells us the name and nature of the country. It says:
        </p>

        <p class="small-text">
            <strong>India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.</strong><br>
            The States and the territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule.<br>
            The territory of India shall comprise -<br>
            - The territories of the States,<br>
            - The Union territories specified in the First Schedule,<br>
            - Any other territories that may be acquired.
        </p>

        <h4>Breaking It Down:</h4>

        <h4>India and Bharat:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            "India, that is Bharat" means our country has two official names: "India" and "Bharat." Just like you might have a nickname and a formal name, India has two names used interchangeably. In Hindi and many Indian languages, we call our country "Bharat," while in English, it's known as "India."
        </p>

        <h4>Union of States:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            "Union of States" means that India is made up of many smaller parts called "states." Imagine India as a big puzzle, and each piece of the puzzle is a state. These states come together to form one big country called India. The word "Union" emphasizes that all these states are united under one central government.
        </p>

        <h4>Territories of India:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            The article also explains that India includes all its states, union territories (like Delhi, Chandigarh, etc.), and any other land that may become part of India in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Historical Context of Article 1</h3>

        <h4>Historical Background:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            When India became independent in 1947, it was divided into different regions: British India (directly governed by the British) and princely states (ruled by local kings and princes). After independence, all these parts were united to form the Union of India.
        </p>

        <h4>Drafting of Article 1:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            The framers of the Constitution wanted to ensure that India would be one single entity without the risk of any state breaking away. They used the term "Union" to reflect this unity, inspired by the structure of countries like the USA, which is also a "union" of states.
        </p>

        <h3>Simple Example to Understand Article 1</h3>
        <p class="small-text">
            Think of India as a "School" and each "State" as a different "Classroom." All the classrooms together form one big school named "India." Each classroom (state) may have its rules and teachers (state governments), but they are all part of the same school, led by a principal (central government) who ensures everyone follows the school's main rules.
        </p>

        <h3>Amendments or Changes Related to Article 1</h3>

        <h4>No Direct Amendments to Article 1:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Article 1 itself has not been changed since it was written. However, the First Schedule (which lists the states and union territories) has been amended many times. For example, when new states were created like Jharkhand in 2000 or Telangana in 2014, or when Jammu and Kashmir's special status was removed in 2019, these changes were reflected in the First Schedule.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="small-text">
            Article 1 establishes the identity of India as a united nation of many states, all coming together to form a single country with two names: India and Bharat. It lays the foundation for a unified nation, where despite the differences, all states are part of one country.

        <h2>Article 2 of the Indian Constitution: Explained Simply</h2>
        <h3>What is Article 2?</h3>
        <p>
            Article 2 of the Indian Constitution gives the Parliament (the lawmakers of India) the power to admit new states into the Union of India and to create new states. Here is what it says:
        </p>

        <p class="small-text">
            <strong>Article 2:</strong> "Parliament may by law admit into the Union, or establish, new States on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit."
        </p>

        <h4>Breaking It Down:</h4>

        <h4>Admit New States:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            This means that if there is a state or territory outside of India (for example, another country or a region) that wants to become part of India, the Indian Parliament can allow this to happen by passing a law.
        </p>

        <h4>Establish New States:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            It also means that the Parliament has the power to create new states within India by changing the boundaries of existing states or by merging smaller regions to create a new state.
        </p>

        <h3>Historical Context of Article 2</h3>

        <h4>Why was Article 2 included?</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            When India became independent in 1947, it was made up of many princely states and territories that needed to be integrated into one nation. Article 2 was included to allow flexibility for adding new regions or territories into the Union of India.
        </p>

        <h4>Example from History:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            One example is the case of Sikkim. Originally, Sikkim was a separate kingdom, but in 1975, it joined India and became the 22nd state of the Union. This was done through Article 2, where the Indian Parliament passed a law to admit Sikkim into India.
        </p>

        <h3>Simple Example to Understand Article 2</h3>
        <p class="small-text">
            Think of India as a "big playground." Sometimes, new kids (territories or regions) want to join the playground and play with everyone else. Article 2 gives the "playground leader" (the Indian Parliament) the power to say, "Yes, you can join us!" and decide the rules for how they can join the playground.
        </p>

        <p class="small-text">
            Similarly, if some kids already on the playground want to form a new team (new state), the leader can also decide if that is possible and under what conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>How Does This Work in Real Life?</h3>

        <h4>Example 1: Goa's Admission into India</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            In 1961, the Indian government decided to make Goa a part of India after it was liberated from Portuguese rule. This was done under the powers given by Article 2, where Goa was admitted as a Union Territory and later became a full state in 1987.
        </p>

        <h4>Example 2: Creation of Telangana</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Although Telangana was created from Andhra Pradesh, this act fell more under Article 3 (which deals with changes in existing states) rather than Article 2. However, Article 2 would apply in a case where an entirely new region, not currently part of India, wants to become a state.
        </p>

        <h3>Amendments or Changes Related to Article 2</h3>

        <h4>No Direct Amendments to Article 2:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Article 2 itself has not been amended since the Constitution was adopted. However, the powers given by this article have been used multiple times to admit new territories or to create states.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="small-text">
            Article 2 is like a flexible rule that allows India to grow by adding new states or territories. It gives Parliament the authority to admit new regions into the country or create new states from existing territories, ensuring that India's map can change as needed to accommodate new members in its Union.

        <h2>Article 3 of the Indian Constitution: Explained Simply</h2>
        <h3>What is Article 3?</h3>
        <p>
            Article 3 of the Indian Constitution gives the Parliament the power to reorganize the states within India. This means Parliament can:
        </p>

        <ul class="small-text">
            <li>Form a new state by separating a part of any state or by merging two or more states.</li>
            <li>Increase or decrease the area of any state.</li>
            <li>Change the boundaries of any state.</li>
            <li>Change the name of any state.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="small-text">
            <strong>Exact Wording of Article 3:</strong> “Parliament may by law:
            <br>(a) form a new State by separation of territory from any State or by uniting two or more States or parts of States or by uniting any territory to a part of any State;
            <br>(b) increase the area of any State;
            <br>(c) diminish the area of any State;
            <br>(d) alter the boundaries of any State;
            <br>(e) alter the name of any State.”
        </p>

        <h4>Breaking It Down:</h4>

        <h4>Create a New State:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Parliament can create a new state by either separating a part from an existing state or combining two or more states or parts of states.
        </p>

        <h4>Change the Area, Boundaries, or Name of States:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Parliament has the authority to increase or decrease the size of a state, change its borders, or even rename a state if necessary.
        </p>

        <h4>Procedure Before Making Any Changes:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Before Parliament makes any changes, it must consult the state(s) concerned by sending the proposal to the state legislature. The state can give its opinion, but Parliament is not bound by it. This means Parliament has the final say.
        </p>

        <h3>Historical Context of Article 3</h3>

        <h4>Why Was Article 3 Included?</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            When India became independent, it had many states and territories that were not well-defined. The framers of the Constitution included Article 3 to allow the country's internal boundaries to be flexible. This helps manage changes in political, administrative, and social needs.
        </p>

        <h4>Example from History: Formation of New States</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Many states were formed after the Constitution was adopted using Article 3. For instance:
        </p>

        <ul class="small-text">
            <li><strong>Andhra Pradesh (1953):</strong> Andhra Pradesh became the first state to be created based on linguistic lines (Telugu-speaking people). It was carved out of Madras State.</li>
            <li><strong>Telangana (2014):</strong> Telangana was formed by separating it from Andhra Pradesh after demands for a separate state for the Telugu-speaking people of that region.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simple Example to Understand Article 3</h3>
        <p class="small-text">
            Imagine India as a big jigsaw puzzle. Each state is a piece of the puzzle. Sometimes, some pieces might be too big, too small, or shaped in a way that does not fit well with the others. Article 3 gives the Parliament (the puzzle maker) the power to cut, reshape, or even rename these pieces so that they all fit together nicely and make a complete picture.
        </p>

        <h3>How Does This Work in Real Life?</h3>

        <h4>Example 1: Formation of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Uttarakhand (2000)</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            These three states were created by separating parts of existing states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, respectively) because the people in these areas wanted their own states to better manage their unique needs and identities. This was done through Article 3.
        </p>

        <h4>Example 2: Changing State Names</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            The name of the state Orissa was changed to Odisha in 2011 to reflect the correct pronunciation in the local language. This change was made using the powers given under Article 3.
        </p>

        <h3>Amendments or Changes Related to Article 3</h3>

        <h4>No Direct Amendments to Article 3:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Article 3 itself has not been amended, but the powers given by this article have been used multiple times to reorganize the states and territories of India.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="small-text">
            Article 3 allows India to change its internal map by creating new states, changing state boundaries, or renaming states as needed. It ensures that India can adapt to the changing needs of its people while maintaining the unity and integrity of the country.

        <h2>Article 4 of the Indian Constitution: Explained Simply</h2>
        
        <h3>What is Article 4?</h3>
        <p>
            Article 4 of the Indian Constitution deals with laws made under Articles 2 and 3. It states that any laws created to admit new states into the Union (Article 2) or to reorganize the existing states (Article 3) are not considered amendments to the Constitution. This means that Parliament can pass such laws without needing to follow the more difficult process of a constitutional amendment.
        </p>
        
        <p class="small-text"><strong>Exact Wording of Article 4:</strong></p>
        <p class="small-text">
            Laws for the Admission or Establishment of New States: "Any law referred to in Article 2 or Article 3 shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the First Schedule and the Fourth Schedule as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the law and may also contain such supplemental, incidental, and consequential provisions as Parliament may deem necessary."
        </p>
        <p class="small-text">
            No Amendment Under Article 368: "No such law as aforesaid shall be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of Article 368."
        </p>
        
        <h4>Breaking It Down:</h4>

        <h4>Simplifying the Process for Changes:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            If Parliament wants to admit a new state (Article 2) or reorganize existing states (Article 3) — like creating a new state, changing boundaries, or renaming a state — it can do so by passing a simple law. This is not considered a formal amendment to the Constitution. It makes the process quicker and simpler.
        </p>

        <h4>First and Fourth Schedules:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            The First Schedule of the Constitution lists all the states and union territories of India. When new states are created or existing states are modified, the First Schedule must be updated.
            <br>The Fourth Schedule allocates seats to the states in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). If a state is created or its area changes, the number of seats may also change. Article 4 allows Parliament to adjust these schedules without needing a complex amendment process.
        </p>

        <h3>Simple Example to Understand Article 4</h3>
        <p class="small-text">
            Imagine India as a "game board" with different regions (states) marked out. Article 2 and Article 3 are like the "rules" that let you add new pieces or change the existing ones. Now, Article 4 says you don't need to rewrite the whole rulebook (Constitution) every time you change the game board — you just update the parts that need changing (like the list of states). This keeps the process quick and straightforward!
        </p>

        <h3>Historical Context of Article 4</h3>

        <h4>Why Was Article 4 Included?</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            When India became independent, the boundaries and the status of many states and regions were unclear and needed frequent changes. Article 4 was included to make sure these changes could be made quickly and efficiently without requiring a complicated amendment process every time.
        </p>

        <h4>Example from History: Creation of New States</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Over the years, Parliament has created new states (like Jharkhand in 2000 or Telangana in 2014) or changed boundaries using the powers given by Articles 2 and 3. Article 4 ensures that these changes only require a simple majority in Parliament and do not count as amendments to the Constitution, which would require a two-thirds majority.
        </p>

        <h3>How Does This Work in Real Life?</h3>

        <h4>Example 1: Changing the Status of Territories:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            When the Union Territory of Goa was made a full state in 1987, Parliament updated the First Schedule to include Goa as a state. This change was made using the powers under Articles 2, 3, and 4 without requiring a formal constitutional amendment.
        </p>

        <h4>Example 2: Modifying State Borders:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Suppose there is a need to change the border between two states, say Maharashtra and Karnataka. Parliament can pass a law for this under Article 3, and any necessary changes to the First Schedule (like new state boundaries) would be automatically covered by Article 4.
        </p>

        <h3>Amendments or Changes Related to Article 4</h3>

        <h4>No Direct Amendments to Article 4:</h4>
        <p class="small-text">
            Article 4 itself has not been amended, but it has been used numerous times to update the First and Fourth Schedules and make necessary changes following the reorganization of states.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="small-text">
            Article 4 serves as a helpful rule that makes sure that changes related to admitting new states or altering existing ones can be done efficiently. It allows Parliament to modify the list of states, their boundaries, and their representation in the Rajya Sabha without the complex process of a constitutional amendment.

            Articles 5 and 6 of the Indian Constitution deal with citizenship at the time the Constitution came into effect, i.e., on January 26, 1950. Let's break down each article to understand what they mean.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Article 5: Citizenship at the Commencement of the Constitution</h4>
        
        <h4>What is Article 5?</h4>
        <p>
            Article 5 defines who would be considered a citizen of India when the Constitution came into effect. It lays down three conditions for a person to be considered a citizen:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Domicile in India:</strong> The person must have their permanent home (domicile) in India.</li>
            <li><strong>Birth in India:</strong> The person must have been born in India.</li>
            <li><strong>Parents' Birth in India or Residency:</strong> If not born in India, either of the person's parents must have been born in India, or the person must have lived in India for at least five years before January 26, 1950.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Breaking It Down with Simple Examples:</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>If You Were Born in India:</strong><br>
            Imagine a person named Raju. Raju was born in India before 1950. According to Article 5, Raju is a citizen of India.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If Your Parents Were Born in India:</strong><br>
            Now, consider another person named Sita, who was not born in India, but her mother was born in India. According to Article 5, Sita is also considered a citizen of India.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If You Lived in India for 5 Years:</strong><br>
            Finally, take a person named Ahmed, who was born outside India, and neither of his parents was born in India. However, Ahmed has been living in India continuously for the last five years before 1950. According to Article 5, Ahmed is a citizen of India.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Purpose of Article 5:</h4>
        <p>
            To provide clarity on who would be considered an Indian citizen at the time the Constitution came into force, especially since India had recently gained independence in 1947 and had a large population of people who might have moved from other places.
        </p>

        <h4>Article 6: Rights of Citizenship of Certain Persons Who Have Migrated to India from Pakistan</h4>
        
        <h4>What is Article 6?</h4>
        <p>
            Article 6 deals with the rights of people who migrated to India from Pakistan around the time of Partition (1947). It sets conditions under which such persons could be considered Indian citizens:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>People Who Migrated Before July 19, 1948:</strong> If a person migrated to India from Pakistan before July 19, 1948, they would be considered a citizen of India if:
                <ul>
                    <li>They or either of their parents or grandparents were born in India (as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935).</li>
                    <li>They have been residing in India since their migration.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>People Who Migrated After July 19, 1948:</strong> If a person migrated to India from Pakistan after July 19, 1948, they would be considered a citizen if:
                <ul>
                    <li>They or either of their parents or grandparents were born in India (as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935).</li>
                    <li>They registered themselves as a citizen of India with an official appointed by the Government of India after having lived in India for at least 6 months before applying for registration.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Breaking It Down with Simple Examples:</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Migrated Before July 19, 1948:</strong><br>
            Consider a person named Ravi, who moved from Lahore (now in Pakistan) to Delhi before July 19, 1948. His father was born in Amritsar, India. Since Ravi moved to India before the cutoff date and his father was born in India, Ravi would be considered an Indian citizen.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Migrated After July 19, 1948:</strong><br>
            Now think of a person named Fatima, who moved from Karachi (now in Pakistan) to Mumbai after July 19, 1948. Fatima’s grandfather was born in Lucknow, India. She registered herself as a citizen of India and had been living in Mumbai for more than 6 months before applying for registration. Under these conditions, Fatima would be considered an Indian citizen.
        </p>

        <h4>Purpose of Article 6:</h4>
        <p>
            To address the situation of people who migrated between India and Pakistan around the time of Partition. Article 6 ensures that those who migrated from Pakistan to India and fulfilled certain conditions were recognized as citizens of India.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why Were Articles 5 and 6 Needed?</h3>
        <p>
            After India gained independence in 1947, the country was divided into two parts: India and Pakistan. This led to the mass movement of people across the new borders. Articles 5 and 6 were created to define who would be considered Indian citizens after these migrations, providing clarity and stability during a period of significant upheaval.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Article 5:</strong> Provides the basic criteria for who would be considered a citizen of India at the time of independence.<br>
            <strong>Article 6:</strong> Addresses the rights of people who migrated from Pakistan to India, ensuring they could be considered Indian citizens if they met certain conditions.<br>
            These articles ensured that people affected by the Partition had a clear path to Indian citizenship.
